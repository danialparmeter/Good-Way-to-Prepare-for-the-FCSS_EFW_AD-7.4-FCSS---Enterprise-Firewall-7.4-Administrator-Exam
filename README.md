<h2>
	1. Understand the Exam Objectives
</h2>
The first step in preparation is understanding the core areas that the exam will cover. The FCSS_EFW_AD-7.4 exam evaluates your proficiency in the following areas:<br />
<br />
<strong>- System Configuration&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />
&nbsp; Learn to implement the Fortinet Security Fabric, configure hardware acceleration, and set up High Availability (HA) clusters. Ensure you're comfortable with VLANs and VDOMs to implement enterprise networks securely.<br />
<br />
<strong>- Central Management&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />
&nbsp; This section will test your ability to manage FortiGate devices using FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer. Familiarize yourself with centralized management of Fortinet solutions.<br />
<br />
<strong>- Security Profiles&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />
&nbsp; You will need to manage and configure security profiles such as SSL/SSH inspection, web filters, application control, and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to safeguard enterprise networks.<br />
<br />
<strong>- Routing&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; Be prepared to implement routing protocols like OSPF and BGP to efficiently route enterprise traffic across the network.<br />
<br />
<strong>- VPN&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />
&nbsp; Understand how to implement IPsec VPN IKE version 2 and ADVPN (Auto Discovery VPN) for on-demand VPN tunneling between different network sites.<br />
<h2>
	2. Hands-On Practice
</h2>
The best way to learn is by doing. Practical experience is crucial for mastering the Fortinet technologies covered in the exam. Set up a lab environment with FortiGate devices, and practice the following:<br />
